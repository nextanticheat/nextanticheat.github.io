                From time to time Android Developers have faced issues with users running 
                them on an Android Emulator or in other words a virtual machine to emulate the 
                Android System.
                <br><br>
                You may now ask yourself why Emulators are such a bad thing so let me explain:
                <br><br>
                Android Emulators are commonly used by cheaters or people that modify your 
                app to gain advantages with for example free premium features. Emulators are 
                really easy to root. (Rooting is basically a way to gain Administrator privileges on 
                Android. I will go over how you can protect your app against this in another post) 
                With that being the case it is easier to modify your app. In case your app is a
                game, people may gain advantages using mouse and keyboard which you may 
                not want in a competitive game.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h2 class="sub-heading">And now to the fun part: How to protect against Emulators!</h2> 
            <p class="post-text">
                Well it’s not too hard. Unexperienced users may use badly hidden Emulators that
                are using certain hardware names such as ‘goldfish’, ‘vbox86’ or other. We can
                detect these names using this piece of code:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
                public boolean checkHardware() {
                    String[] hardwareNames = {
                        "goldfish",
                        "vbox86",
                        "nox",
                        "VM_x86",
                        "intel",
                        "amd",
                        "x86",
                    };
                
                    String hardware = Build.HARDWARE.toLowerCase();
                
                    for (String s : hardwareNames) {
                        if (hardware.equals(s)) {
                            return true;
                        }
                    }
                }
            </code></pre>
            <p class="post-text">
                Pretty easy until now. But of course there are Emulators that are way more 
                advanced such as ‘Bluestacks’. This Emulator is pretty good at hiding the fact that
                it’s an Emulator so we have to get a bit more advanced here. Every emulator 
                needs some files deep down in the Android System to make Input or Networking 
                work. We can use these files for our advantage and make a function that will 
                check for such files. You may ask how to find these file and it’s quite simple.
                <br><br>
                Disclaimer: These steps require a normal phone (Needs to be rooted) or 
                the android system inside an virtualisation software such as VmWare so 
                you have a android installation without any of the Emulator files. <br>
                Please look for a tutorial for that on your own. <br><br>
                Step 1: 
                Root your Emulator. (Most of the time you can find a root 
                option in the setting of your Emulator). <br>
                <br>
                Step 2: 
                Download a 'Root File Manager' on your Emulator <br>
                <br>
                Step 3: 
                In case of Bluestacks search for files that have <br>
                'bluestacks' or 'bst' in their name. <br>
                <br>
                Step 4: 
                On your non Emulator installation (Phone or VmWare) look for 
                the same file. Keep in mind that some files change by the Android Version 
                so make sure it really belongs to Bluestacks. <br>
                <br>
                Step 5: 
                You are done.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Luckily for you I have already found a few of these files using the method above.</h2> 
            <p class="post-text">
                "/data/.bluestacks.prop" <br>
                "/data/.bstconf.prop" <br>
                "/mnt/windows" <br>
                "/mnt/windows/BstSharedFolder" <br>
                "/mnt/prebundledapps/downloads/com.bluestacks.home.apk" <br>
                "/mnt/prebundledapps/bst_appdetails_bgptest" <br>
                "/system/priv-app/com.bluestacks.bstfolder.apk" <br>

                <br><br>
                Of course I won’t share all of the files I found because I want you to do some of 
                the work yourself so you actually learn something from this :) <br><br>

                Anyways. Here is the code you need to check for these files. You can definitely 
                expand this code to also detect files from other Emulators such as Nox.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
                public boolean checkFiles() {
                    String[] files = {
                        "/data/.bluestacks.prop",
                        "/data/.bstconf.prop",
                        "/mnt/windows",
                        "/mnt/windows/BstSharedFolder",
                        "/mnt/prebundledapps/downloads/com.bluestacks.home.apk",
                        "/mnt/prebundledapps/bst_appdetails_bgptest",
                        "/system/priv-app/com.bluestacks.bstfolder.apk",
                    };
                
                    for (String s : files) {
                        File f = new File(s);
                        if (f.exists() && !f.isDirectory()) {
                            return true;
                        }
                    }
                    return false;
                }
            </code></pre>

                Obviously there are many more options to detect Emulators, but this last method 
                is the most reliable.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h2 class="sub-heading">In conclusion:</h2> 
            <p class="post-text">
                Detecting Emulators isn’t that hard and there are many more methods that these 
                two I have showed. Obviously everything can be hacked so there is no 100% way to
                fully detect emulators so make sure to check out our next article where we show 
                how you can make your game more secure and protect it.
