                Cheating has been a problem for a very long time now, in every competition we have cheaters that 
                want to gain an advantage over fair players. In this article you will learn about 4 easy steps on how
                you can protect your game against cheaters.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h2 class="sub-heading">How does cheating work?</h2> 
            <p class="post-text">
                There are 2 ways to cheat on mobile: <br>
                1. Memory Editors <br>
                   Memory editors like GameGuardian are commonly used to manipulate the games memory to 
                   modify values such as currency, the problem is that this tool makes it hard to detect due to it 
                   using a random package name everytime its being installed. <br> <br>
                2. Memory Patch cheats <br>
                   Memory cheats write to the games shared library (libil2cpp.so for unity games), there are 
                   usually called hex patches because you override the hex for a certian address in the library. 
                   Internal cheats like these are easier to detect than memory editors. <br> <br>
                The following things are not necessary cheating tools but make cheating easier: <br> 
                1. Android Emulators <br> 
                   Android Emulators can provide an easy solution for rooting a device (root is basically like 
                   administrator privileges on android). Root allows you to run previously mentioned tools like 
                   Game Guardian. Android Emulators also may make your game less competitive because some 
                   people gain advantages through playing on keyboard and mouse.  <br> <br>
                2. Parallel Space <br>
                   There is absolutely no reason for a user to run your app inside a parallel space app. Parallel 
                   space is usually used to use tools such as GameGuardian without rooting your device. It also 
                   allows players to not get their main account banned because of cheating. <br> <br>
                3. Root <br>
                   As previously mentioned, root allows you to run external cheats and memory editors that are 
                   hard to detect by the game. <br> <br>

            <p class="post-text">
                1. A android java plugin for unity OR knowledge about JNI in C# <br>
                I will leave a youtube tutorial I found below <br>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">4 Ways to detect Cheats on Android</h2> 
            <h2 class="sub-heading-new">1. Detect Android Emulators</h2> 
            <p class="post-text">
                We already make a complete guide <br> https://nextanticheat.me/blog/posts/emulator-detection.html <br>
                on how to detect Android Emulators, please refer to that.
                <br> <br>
            </p>
            <h2 class="sub-heading-new">2. Internal Cheat Detection</h2> 
            <p class="post-text">
                There are a lot of ways to detect if an internal cheat exists inside of the game, we can simply scan <br>  <br>

                /data/app/com.package.name/lib/ <br>   <br>
                
                Here we have 2 options, we can check if there are any libs that should not be there, we could 
                use a list of libraries that are trusted such as: <br>  <br>
                
                libil2cpp.so <br>
                libunity.so  <br>
                libmain.so  <br>  <br>
                
                This system works but is more work than the system I am about to show you.  <br>
                It uses the same directory, but instead of checking for names, we can check for the amount 
                of files in this folder, this makes it very easy to update.  <br>
                The following code will do that:


                <pre><code>
                    public String GetLibraryDirectory() throws PackageManager.NameNotFoundException {
                        // Get the current activity from untiy through a jni call from C#
                        String packageName = unityActivity.getPackageName();
                        
                        PackageManager packageManager = AndroidPlugin.unityActivity.getPackageManager();
                        PackageInfo packageInfo = packageManager.getPackageInfo(packageName, 128);
                        ApplicationInfo applicationInfo = packageInfo.applicationInfo;
                        
                        return applicationInfo.nativeLibraryDir;
                    }
                
                public void VerifyLibs() throws PackageManager.NameNotFoundException {
                        int amount = GetAmountOfFilesInDirectory(GetLibraryDirectory().toString());
                        if (amount == AndroidPlugin.NormalLibAmount) {
                            Log.i("", "Nothing detected");
                        } else {
                            Log.i("", "Internal Cheat detected");
                            System.exit(0); //Just an example, you can handle a detection however you want
                        }
                    }
                
                public int GetAmountOfFilesInDirectory(String path) {
                    File directory = new File(path);
                    return directory.listFiles().lengh;
                }
                </code></pre>
                <br>
            </p>
            <h2 class="sub-heading-new">3. Root</h2> 
            <p class="post-text">
                As already mentioned previously, root can be used to use external cheats like GameGuardian or 
                external cheats, that do the same thing as internal cheats, just from another app. To do that
                though, you need root privileges. <br> <br>

                We can check a file called mounts which is located at /proc/mounts in the android file system
                <br>
                <pre><code>
                    public boolean checkForMagisk(View view) throws IOException {
                        BufferedReader reader;
                        try {
                            reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("/proc/mounts"));
                            String line = reader.readLine();
                            while (line != null) {
                                if (line.contains("magisk")) {
                                                    //Handle the detection
                                    Log.e("", "Magisk Detected");
                                }
                                line = reader.readLine();
                            }
                            reader.close();
                        } catch (IOException e) {
                            e.printStackTrace();
                        }
                    }
                </code></pre>
                <br>
            </p>
            <h2 class="sub-heading-new">4. Obfuscation</h2> 
            <p class="post-text">
                Obfuscating your code makes it a lot harder to hack your game, I will show you an example: <br>

                Unobfuscated decompiled unity code:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
                private void MyMonobehaviour(string SomeString)
                {
                }
            </code></pre>
            <p class="post-text">
                Obfuscated decompiled unity code:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
                private void b(string a)
                {
                }
            </code></pre>
            <p class="post-text">
                This makes it way harder to find out what the method actually does. <br> <br>
                For unity I reccomend you one of the following obfuscators: <br>

                1. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/obfuscator-free-89420 <br>
                2. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/obfuscator-48919 <br>
                <br>
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">In conclusion:</h2> 
            <p class="post-text">
                It is not that hard to protect your game from cheaters. If you spend a bit of time on 
                investigating commonly used cheating apps and find out how they work, you can easily extend 
                this anti cheat with your own detections. If you have questions contact
